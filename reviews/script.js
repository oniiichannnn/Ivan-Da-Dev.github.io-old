        review: "I have finished **all** seasons about A Certain Magical Index. I LOVED IT, it has action, comedy and harem. Not only that but it has adventure too (now you're concept of adventure might be different than mine, adventure in my mind means going to places), every time I look back at this anime, it makes me feel nostalgic. This anime was always entertaining me during quarantine. Tho the reason why I gave it a 9 was because of Index, shes fucking useless but shes fucking funny and cute too. So shes a good character when it comes to anything other than fighting, shes a good support, knowledgeable, annoying, cute and lazy",

'U sick bastard how can u not enjoy darling in the franxx', well I prefer the 02 that loves to tease the MC but when they maked up at episode 6 or 7 or 8, 02 completely changed from a teaser to a normal girl, I rated it 10 because the plot is very good lmao. I didn't expect 02 and the MC to be giant spaceships and die together in the end. I ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT THOSE 2 KIDS TO HAVE SEX AND HAVE A BABY HOLY FUC- Oh I lost my composure there. I love it how they use the power system, whats a \"power system\" u ask? For example, 02 has the authority to go wherever she wants and do what she wants. They know what 02 is doing but they can't stop her because shes plays a important role too, I like how 02 keeps saying darling, this anime also feels nostalgic when thinking back",

Yeah, they recycled (they removed her old memories and personality) Isla and gave tsukasa the recycled Isla, man thats even worse than Isla dying tbh. Why did this anime make me cry but I didn't cry when I watched \"A silent voice\"? Men, because this anime has 13 episodes (13 x 24 minutes = 312 minutes) while A silent voice was just 2 hours (120 minutes) long. Not only that but in a silent voice's ending, no one died while in plastic memories's ending, Isla died, well her old self died. And I wouldn't cry if it wasn't for Isla's last speech at the end, its so fucking sad and plus they added sad music in the background. This anime was rated a 10 because its the first and I hope it isn't the last anime to make me cry. It has a solid plot, solid characters and a good name",

So basically what the movie is about is that theres a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, he keeps getting his mind swapped with a girl named Mitsuha, this keeps continuing for a few months, they are from different time stamps, meh I'm too lazy to type the whole description, go view it on MAL or somewhere. Taki finds out that Mitsuha's village is gonna get crushed by a meteor, so to save Mitsuha, **he drinks sake and fucking time trvales back in time** :woa:. Anyways, so Taki and Mitsuha both successfully saves Mitsuha's village by evacuting everyone to a place where the meteor won't hit. HOWEVER, since Mitsuha never died, this causes the butterfly effect, Taki never knew who Mitsuha is. But in the end they met when they were adults and Taki kinda recognizes Mitsuha and they lived happily ever after. Why did I rate it a 8? because it didn't make me cry like I expected it to be and hey, if it weren't for the music, I would've gave it a 5",

If you started with kizumonogatari and dropped it because of the brutality, well you can ignore my opinion but you should keep continuing. The monogatari series isn't as brutal as kizu makes it look like. Its really interesting the way they animate and plan the timeline. The monogatari series is the best mystery anime imo, because they don't air the anime according to its plot's timeline, they would randomly air a season and then air another season on a completely different timeline as you can tell from each season's release date. Not only that but what makes it godly to me is the way they animate it, have you ever wondered what a anime with 98% text look like? Well that would be the monogatari series, not only does Araragi talk all the time, but they even add text flash scenes which look like this: @./monogatari_flash_scene.png@ that always irritates me because I would have to go back and pause the video to look what it said (altho I usually ignore them).

But NOPE, it was the MC who died, well not died but was unconcious for the whole time and it was his wife (which is also Ruri btw) who kept trying to bring him back, if you didn't notice this, the animation style in the movie (for the most part) was 3d but when the MC wakes up in his real world, the animation was in 2d as u can see this is\n\n**The 3D scenes:** @./hello_world_3d.jpg@ **The Ending scene (2D)**: @./hello_world_2d.jpg@ and Kai Tanaka commented this on the comments section of Hello world in AnimeDao\n\nIf you’ll look closely, you’ll notice that all the events of the “past” and “present-past” timelines involve 3-D animation, whereas, the events of the final “present timeline” have 2-D animation. This creates a contrast between the simulated and actual events of the anime’s storyline. Also, **since the movie is all about complex programming and its manipulation, its title alludes to the “Hello World” program which is often used to represent the basic syntax of a programming language**\n\nThats also a unique aspect about their animations and holy fuck I JUST DISCOVERED THERES A SEQUEL CALLED ANOTHER WORLD, I will watch it and update this when I am done\n\n\nI have finished watching the sequel for it, and boy, not gonna lie I was dissapointed.

        review: "Watched this anime when I was a normie and its pretty good. I like how they used a cinderella reference but with panties, and that the mc is looking for this \"cinderella\" but ignores all the cute girls he has surrounding him. I would've preferred him dating his sister in the end (btw his sister was the cinderella), don't worry, they are not blood related, but the MC still can't do it, what a pussy am I right?",

It ranks #1 in among all scenario animes I've watched (scenario animes are animes that has a different situation for each episode, each episode theres new content and none or not much of it was taken from the previous episode, it could also be called a \"no plot\" anime). It has cute characters @./mcpw_characters.jpg@ even the villians are cute @./mcpw_villian.jpg@ it makes me relax everytime when watching this anime. Sad that it couldn't get a season 2 but it'll remain in my memory as the best scenario anime",
