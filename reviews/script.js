One day when sulking in the bathtub, a mysterious, naked devil-tailed girl appears out of nowhere. Her name is Lala Satalin Deviluke, the runaway crown princess of the planet Deviluke. Her father wants her to return home to marry one of her marriage candidates. When Devilukean commander Zastin arrives to bring her home, she swiftly declares she will marry Rito in order to stay on Earth, leading Zastin to attack Rito. But when Rito angrily declares that marriage is only possible with the person you love, the two dull-witted aliens misunderstand him, believing he truly understands Lala\'s feelings.\n\nLala quickly falls in love with him, and Zastin also approves of their engagement, much to Rito\'s dismay. While Zastin reports his support for the pair to Lala\'s father, Gid Lucion Deviluke, who is the King of Deviluke and much of the known universe, Rito reluctantly helps Lala transition to life on Earth, while gradually befriending his dream girl, Haruna, along with a colorful cast of other girls (both humans and aliens), such as the uptight, high-strung girl Yui Kotegawa, the gender-switching alien Run/Ren, and the queen bee Saki Tenjouin, among others. In the meantime, Rito must also fight off Lala\'s antagonistic alien suitors, one of whom sends the alien assassin Golden Darkness to kill him.',

Didn't Isla came back to life at the end?" no, remember that they mention they recycle used androids in order to save money? Yeah, they recycled (they removed her old memories and personality) Isla and gave tsukasa the recycled Isla, man thats even worse than Isla dying tbh. Why did this anime make me cry but I didn't cry when I watched "A silent voice"? Men, because this anime has 13 episodes (13 x 24 minutes = 312 minutes) while A silent voice was just 2 hours (120 minutes) long. Not only that but in a silent voice's ending, no one died while in plastic memories's ending, Isla died, well her old self died. And I wouldn't cry if it wasn't for Isla's last speech at the end, its so fucking sad and plus they added sad music in the background. This anime was rated a 10 because its the first and I hope it isn't the last anime to make me cry. It has a solid plot, solid characters and a good name`,

I like how they used a cinderella reference but with panties, and that the mc is looking for this "cinderella" but ignores all the cute girls he has surrounding him. I would've preferred him dating his sister in the end (btw his sister was the cinderella), don't worry, they are not blood related, but the MC still can't do it, what a pussy am I right?`,

      review: `This was the first anime that I watched. Half of it was good. 'U sick bastard how can u not enjoy darling in the franxx', well I prefer the 02 that loves to tease the MC but when they maked up at episode 6 or 7 or 8, 02 completely changed from a teaser to a normal girl, I rated it 10 because the plot is very good lmao. I didn't expect 02 and the MC to be giant spaceships and die together in the end. I ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT THOSE 2 KIDS TO HAVE SEX AND HAVE A BABY HOLY FUC- Oh I lost my composure there. I love it how they use the power system, whats a "power system" u ask? For example, 02 has the authority to go wherever she wants and do what she wants. They know what 02 is doing but they can't stop her because shes plays a important role too, I like how 02 keeps saying darling, this 
  anime also feels nostalgic when thinking back`,

Hiyori demands that Yato return her to normal, but upon learning that he needs a new partner to do so, reluctantly agrees to help him find one.
