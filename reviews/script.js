        review: "I have finished **all** seasons about A Certain Magical Index. I LOVED IT, it has action, comedy and harem. Not only that but it has adventure too (now you're concept of adventure might be different than mine, adventure in my mind means going to places), every time I look back at this anime, it makes me feel nostalgic. This anime was always entertaining me during quarantine. Tho the reason why I gave it a 9 was because of Index, shes fucking useless but shes fucking funny and cute too. So shes a good character when it comes to anything other than fighting, shes a good support, knowledgeable, annoying, cute and lazy",

'U sick bastard how can u not enjoy darling in the franxx', well I prefer the 02 that loves to tease the MC but when they maked up at episode 6 or 7 or 8, 02 completely changed from a teaser to a normal girl, I rated it 10 because the plot is very good lmao. I didn't expect 02 and the MC to be giant spaceships and die together in the end. I ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT THOSE 2 KIDS TO HAVE SEX AND HAVE A BABY HOLY FUC- Oh I lost my composure there. I love it how they use the power system, whats a \"power system\" u ask? For example, 02 has the authority to go wherever she wants and do what she wants. They know what 02 is doing but they can't stop her because shes plays a important role too, I like how 02 keeps saying darling, this anime also feels nostalgic when thinking back",

Didn't Isla came back to life at the end?\" no, remember that they mention they recycle used androids in order to save money? Yeah, they recycled (they removed her old memories and personality) Isla and gave tsukasa the recycled Isla, man thats even worse than Isla dying tbh. Why did this anime make me cry but I didn't cry when I watched \"A silent voice\"? Men, because this anime has 13 episodes (13 x 24 minutes = 312 minutes) while A silent voice was just 2 hours (120 minutes) long. Not only that but in a silent voice's ending, no one died while in plastic memories's ending, Isla died, well her old self died. And I wouldn't cry if it wasn't for Isla's last speech at the end, its so fucking sad and plus they added sad music in the background. This anime was rated a 10 because its the first and I hope it isn't the last anime to make me cry. It has a solid plot, solid characters and a good name",

        review: "A lot of people said that this is a sad anime so I decided to watch it, and boy it wasn't sad at all. So basically what the movie is about is that theres a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, he keeps getting his mind swapped with a girl named Mitsuha, this keeps continuing for a few months, they are from different time stamps, meh I'm too lazy to type the whole description, go view it on MAL or somewhere. Taki finds out that Mitsuha's village is gonna get crushed by a meteor, so to save Mitsuha, **he drinks sake and fucking time trvales back in time** :woa:. Anyways, so Taki and Mitsuha both successfully saves Mitsuha's village by evacuting everyone to a place where the meteor won't hit. HOWEVER, since Mitsuha never died, this causes the butterfly effect, Taki never knew who Mitsuha is. But in the end they met when they were adults and Taki kinda recognizes Mitsuha and they lived happily ever after. Why did I rate it a 8? because it didn't make me cry like I expected it to be and hey, if it weren't for the music, I would've gave it a 5",

Although it may look like a diving related anime but the anime is 10% about diving and 90% about naked men drinking. They did a perfect job of adding slice of life and comedy together, the art style just tops it all, they draw really contrasted faces when its comedy time lmao for example: @./gb_shocked.jpg@ which makes it 100 times funnier",

        review: "I started with kizumonogatari, meaning I watched the most brutal scenes among the monogatari series. If you started with kizumonogatari and dropped it because of the brutality, well you can ignore my opinion but you should keep continuing. The monogatari series isn't as brutal as kizu makes it look like. Its really interesting the way they animate and plan the timeline. The monogatari series is the best mystery anime imo, because they don't air the anime according to its plot's timeline, they would randomly air a season and then air another season on a completely different timeline as you can tell from each season's release date. Not only that but what makes it godly to me is the way they animate it, have you ever wondered what a anime with 98% text look like? Well that would be the monogatari series, not only does Araragi talk all the time, but they even add text flash scenes which look like this: @./monogatari_flash_scene.png@ that always irritates me because I would have to go back and pause the video to look what it said (altho I usually ignore them). Well in case you read this and you want to watch the monogatari series according to the order I watched, [press me to watch the monogatari series on a pirated anime website](https://animedao.to/anime/kizumonogatari/)",

When starting at episode 1 I loved kirino because I am also a incest lover myself ya know <lenny>, everyone hated Kirino when I saw the comments section lmao, because of her attitude, tho I still liked her despite that. The first season was great, it introduced the characters, introduced the MC and Kirino's character development, but when I was near the ending at season 2, I see the MC rejects all off Kirino's friends who confessed to him and that includes Ayasake @./ayase.jpg@ and I was PISSED at the MC because Ayase is the 2nd best character in the anime, shes popular, cute, knows how to cook and doesn't have a shit attitude. Tho I can relate that the MC only has his eyes for Kirino, when I was watching the last episode, I was excited to see him and Kirino getting married, and they did have a wedding @./oreimo_wedding.jpg@ of course it was not a official wedding and no one attended the wedding either, why? Because they broke up after the wedding......\n\nThis is why I hate it, bruh MC u rejected 4 or 5 cute girls just to get married and break up after it? smh I'm still pissed at the MC",

When I finished season 1, I watched season 2 despite being sleepy but only to be dissapointed, in season 2, they **COMPLETELY** changed the characters, they changed the MC as well. They add a new plot where a girl wants to be Aria's apprentice and wants to be cool like Aria. They completely forgotten about Shinji and his brother who never appeared (well Shinji did appear but for less than 10 minutes in the **whole** season), oh yeah, Shinji is the MC in season 1.
